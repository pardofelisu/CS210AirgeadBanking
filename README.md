# CS210AirgeadBanking
Code for 5-3 project two 

This is the second project in the CS210 course @ SNHU, where we have to:
      
    *calculate bank balances without a monthly deposit being made. 
    *calculate bank balances with a monthly deposit being made. 
    *format a table of values for display based on which balance 

I believe I did an ok job at using loops to figure out how much the balance would be with and without monthly deposits, 
though I did neglect to round any of the decimals, resulting in numbers such as #.### when money is usually in #.## formatting.
I could have also made a class for Interests as a whole, whixh would have made my code a bit neater. Having 
private and public mutators and accessors would have made the code more secure if it were to be used in a real banking circumstance,
but alas. One major chalenge I had was displaying the menu properly, where some of the data would show off centered. I've managed to
fix it in the end, though not perfect. Looking at other people's code for similar projects and googling basic things such as
how to implement the 'press any key to continue' helped me a lot. Doing this project made me learn how to properly debug since I am usually
used to only doing smaller projects than this and NOT going slowly. This project forced me to program it in stages and testing it as I go.
Luckily I added comments to briefly describe what a function is doing, so down the line I can go back and upgrade the code and make it better.
Looking back, this project was my favorite-- it wasn't too hard and was actually quite fun to do. Playing with newly learned topics was the highlight
to the project, and I believe it made me master a few programming skills, too.
